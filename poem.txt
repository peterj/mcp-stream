Whispers of Dawn

Morning light filters through leaves of jade,
Dancing shadows in the forest glade.
Dewdrops glisten like scattered stars,
While birdsong echoes near and far.

The ancient oak stretches toward the sky,
As morning mist begins to fly.
Nature wakes with gentle grace,
In this serene and sacred space.

Time flows like a mountain stream,
Reality merges with morning's dream.
In this moment, pure and bright,
The world transforms with dawning light.
